# Sublime Text Community Documentation

We started this project
to fill the gaps 
in the Sublime Text [official documentation][off-docs].

***[Read this guide online for free.][undocs]***

You can follow our progress here and
on our public [Trello board][trello].

Huge thanks to [all our backers](./BACKERS.md)
from our [fundraiser on BountySource][fundraiser]!


## Contributing

This guide is hosted on _Github Pages_ and
built with [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org).

We accept error reports and requests for new content
via our [issue tracker][issues],
and encourage you to send pull requests
(but we cannot guarantee
they will always be merged).

**Please follow our style guidelines
as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).**

This repository includes a `.sublime-project`
with predefined settings and helpful build systems.
