# Sublime Text Unofficial Documentation

We started this project
to fill the gaps in the Sublime Text [official documentation][off-docs].

**[Read this guide][undocs]** online for free.

Following our [fundraiser on BountySource][fundraiser]
during July-August 2014,
we've started revising all topics
and adding new ones.
You can follow our progress here and
on our public [Trello board][trello].

Huge thanks to [all our backers](./BACKERS.md)!


## Contributing

This guide is hosted on _Github Pages_ and
built with [Vuepress](http://vuepress.vuejs.org)

We accept error reports and requests for new content
via our [issue tracker][issues],
and encourage you to send pull requests

This repository includes a `.sublime-project`
with predefined settings and a build system
that builds the HTML docs using Sphinx.
