Sublime Text is brim-full of editing features. This topic just
scratches the surface of what's possible.

## Multiple Selections

Multiple selections let you make sweeping changes to your text efficiently.
Any praise about multiple selections is an understatement. This is why:

Select some text and press <kbd>Ctrl + D</kbd> to **add more** instances. If
you want **to skip the current instance**, press <kbd>Ctrl + K, Ctrl + D</kbd>.

If you go too far, press <kbd>Ctrl + U</kbd> to **deselect** the current instance.


## Transforming Multiple Selections into Lines

<kbd>Ctrl + L</kbd> expands the selections to the end of the line. 
<kbd>Ctrl + Shift + L</kbd> splits the selections into lines.

You can copy multiple selected lines to a separate buffer, edit them there,
select the content again as multiple lines and then paste them back into
place in the first buffer.


## Column Selection

You can select a rectangular area of a file. Column selection makes use of
multiple selections.

It's possible to add blocks of text to or remove them from the selection.

## Other Ways of Selecting Text

The list is long; all available options can be found under **Selection**. To
name a few:

* Select subwords (<kbd>Alt + Shift + ←/→</kbd>)
* Expand selection to brackets (<kbd>Ctrl + Shift + M</kbd>)
* Expand selection to indentation (<kbd>Ctrl + Shift + J</kbd>)
* Expand selection to scope (<kbd>Ctrl + Shift + Space</kbd>)


## Transposing Things

Need to swap two letters or, better yet, two words? Experiment with
<kbd>Ctrl + T</kbd>.


## And much, much more...

The **Edit**, **Selection**, **Find** and **Goto** menus are good places to
look for handy editing tools. You might end up using just a few of them,
but the rest will still be there for when you need them.
