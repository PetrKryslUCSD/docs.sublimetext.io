Build systems let you run your files
through external programs like
**make**, **tidy**, interpreters, etc.

Executables called from build systems
must be in your **`PATH`**.
For more information about making sure
the **`PATH`** seen by Sublime Text
is set correctly, see [Troubleshooting Build Systems](../reference.html#troubleshooting-build-systems).


## File Format

Build systems are JSON files
and have the extension `.sublime-build`.

### Example

Here's an example of a build system:

```js
{
    "cmd": ["python", "-u", "$file"],
    "file_regex": "^[ ]*File \"(...*?)\", line ([0-9]*)",
    "selector": "source.python"
}
```

`cmd`
    Required. This option contains the actual command line
    to be executed::

```bash
python -u /path/to/current/file.ext
```

`file_regex`
    A Perl-style regular expression
    to capture error information
    from an external program's output.
    This information is used
    to help you navigate through error instances with `F4`.

`selector`
    If the **Tools | Build System | Automatic** option is set,
    Sublime Text will automatically find
    the corresponding build system for the active file
    by matching `selector` to the file's scope.

In addition to options,
you can use some variables in build systems too,
as we have done above with `$file`,
which expands to the active buffer's filename.


## Where to Store Build Systems

Build systems must be located somewhere
under the `{Packages}` folder
(e.g. `{Packages}/User`).
Many packages include their own build systems.


## Running Build Systems

Build systems can be run by pressing <kbd>`F7`</kbd>
or from **Tools â†’ Build**.
