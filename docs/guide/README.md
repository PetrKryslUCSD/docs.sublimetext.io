Welcome to the community-driven documentation project
for the Sublime Text editor!

[Sublime Text][] is a versatile and fun text editor 
for code and prose that automates repetitive tasks so you can focus the 
important stuff. It works on OS X, Windows and Linux.

If you're starting out with Sublime Text, read the [Basic Concepts][]
section first.

Happy learning!
