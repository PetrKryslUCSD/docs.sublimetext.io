Welcome to the unofficial documentation for the Sublime Text editor!

![Sublime Text](../images/1-about-the-documentation.png)

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a versatile and fun text editor for code and prose that automates repetitive tasks so you can focus the important stuff. It works on OS X, Windows and Linux.

If you're starting out with Sublime Text, read the [Basic Concepts](./basic-concepts/) section first.

Happy learning!
