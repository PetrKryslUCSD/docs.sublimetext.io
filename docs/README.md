The Sublime Text Unofficial Documentation is a community effort at documenting the [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com/) editor. It was started by [Guillermo LÃ³pez-Anglada](https://github.com/guillermooo) in 2010 and later joined by [FichteFoll](https://github.com/FichteFoll) in 2013, receiving countless contributions by other members of the community through its entire lifetime. In 2014, it was backed by a fundraiser and supported by individuals and Sublime HQ Pty Ltd.

After the the previously hosted version on _http://docs.sublimetext.info/_ went down and the maintainer of both the repo and the domain could not be contacted anymore, the project was rebooted under its current domain of _https://docs.sublimetext.io/_, which is a fork of the original under the old more permissive license.

::: warning Notice
This documentation is currently undergoing updates and modifications. In addition, Sublime Text **4** documentation is also being created.
